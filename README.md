# Task Management App - Frontend Internship Project

This project is a fully functional Task Management application developed as part of my Web Development Internship. It demonstrates my proficiency in utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build dynamic, interactive web applications.

## Task Overview:
As part of my internship, I was assigned to **create a To-Do list** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The key features of this application include:
- Add, edit, and remove tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed or pending.
- Clear all tasks or completed tasks.
- Store tasks in the browser using `localStorage`.
- Implement a visually appealing design with interactive elements.

## Project Overview:
- **HTML**: Structured the application, providing elements to display tasks, input fields for adding new tasks, and various controls for interaction.
- **CSS**: Styled the Task Manager with a modern, responsive design, including hover effects, task status indicators, and smooth transitions for an enhanced user experience.
- **JavaScript**: Added interactive features such as:
  - Add and remove tasks.
  - Mark tasks as complete or pending.
  - Persist tasks using `localStorage` so that tasks remain even after a page refresh.
  - Toggle dark mode and background visibility.
  - Background music functionality with play/pause toggle.

## Key Features:
- **Task Management**: Users can add, edit, and remove tasks dynamically, with a set of attributes like due date, priority, category, tags, notes, and recurrence.
- **Task Completion**: Tasks can be marked as completed or pending, with status changes reflected through visual indicators (checkboxes, colors).
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved using the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring persistence even when the page is refreshed or reopened.
- **Responsive Design**: The Task Management app is designed to be responsive, ensuring usability across a variety of devices and screen sizes.
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Filter tasks by status (completed, incomplete, or all).
  - Sort tasks alphabetically, by due date, or by priority.
  - Clear completed tasks with a single click.
  - Toggle background visibility and dark mode.
  - Play/pause background music for a dynamic, personalized experience.

## Task 1: Create To-Do List Using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript
The first task in this internship project was to create a simple To-Do list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This task helped to establish a foundation for understanding the key features and principles of web development. The core functionality of this task includes:
- **Task Addition**: Users can add tasks with a title and due date.
- **Task Deletion**: Users can remove tasks.
- **Marking Tasks as Complete**: Tasks can be marked as completed or incomplete.
- **Persistent Storage**: The tasks are stored in `localStorage`, which allows them to persist after the page refresh.

## Skills & Technologies:
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the app and its components.
- **CSS**: Styled the interface with a modern look, including hover effects, transitions, and a clean, responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented dynamic features such as task management, sorting, filtering, and localStorage support, along with interactive UI elements like dark mode and background music.

This project demonstrates my ability to build and style interactive, user-friendly web applications. It showcases my understanding of frontend technologies and commitment to providing engaging, functional solutions during my internship.
