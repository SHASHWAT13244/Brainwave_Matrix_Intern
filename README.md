https://shashwat13244.github.io/-To-Do-List-App/

This project is a fully functional Task Management application developed as part of my Web Development Internship at Brainwave Matrix Solutions. It demonstrates my proficiency in utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build dynamic, interactive web applications.

## Task  1 Overview:
As part of my internship, I was assigned to **create a To-Do list** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The key features of this application include:
- Add, edit, and remove tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed or pending.
- Clear all tasks or completed tasks.
- Store tasks in the browser using `localStorage`.
- Implement a visually appealing design with interactive elements.

## Project Overview:
- **HTML**: Structured the application, providing elements to display tasks, input fields for adding new tasks, and various controls for interaction.
- **CSS**: Styled the Task Manager with a modern, responsive design, including hover effects, task status indicators, and smooth transitions for an enhanced user experience.
- **JavaScript**: Added interactive features such as:
  - Add and remove tasks.
  - Mark tasks as complete or pending.
  - Persist tasks using `localStorage` so that tasks remain even after a page refresh.
  - Toggle dark mode and background visibility.
  - Background music functionality with play/pause toggle.

## Key Features:
- **Task Management**: Users can add, edit, and remove tasks dynamically, with a set of attributes like due date, priority, category, tags, notes, and recurrence.
- **Task Completion**: Tasks can be marked as completed or pending, with status changes reflected through visual indicators (checkboxes, colors).
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved using the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring persistence even when the page is refreshed or reopened.
- **Responsive Design**: The Task Management app is designed to be responsive, ensuring usability across a variety of devices and screen sizes.
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Filter tasks by status (completed, incomplete, or all).
  - Sort tasks alphabetically, by due date, or by priority.
  - Clear completed tasks with a single click.
  - Toggle background visibility and dark mode.
  - Play/pause background music for a dynamic, personalized experience.

## Task 1: Create To-Do List Using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript
The first task in this internship project was to create a simple To-Do list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This task helped to establish a foundation for understanding the key features and principles of web development. The core functionality of this task includes:
- **Task Addition**: Users can add tasks with a title and due date.
- **Task Deletion**: Users can remove tasks.
- **Marking Tasks as Complete**: Tasks can be marked as completed or incomplete.
- **Persistent Storage**: The tasks are stored in `localStorage`, which allows them to persist after the page refresh.

## Skills & Technologies:
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the app and its components.
- **CSS**: Styled the interface with a modern look, including hover effects, transitions, and a clean, responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented dynamic features such as task management, sorting, filtering, and localStorage support, along with interactive UI elements like dark mode and background music.

This project demonstrates my ability to build and style interactive, user-friendly web applications. It showcases my understanding of frontend technologies and commitment to providing engaging, functional solutions during my internship.


# task-2  Sports E-commerce - Frontend Internship Project
https://shashwat13244.github.io/Sports-E-commerce-/
This project is a fully functional **Sports E-commerce website** developed as part of my Web Development Internship at **Brainwave Matrix Solutions**. It demonstrates my proficiency in utilizing **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to build dynamic, interactive web applications.

## Task  2 Overview:

- **Persistent Cart**: Cart data is saved in the browser's **localStorage**, ensuring the cart contents persist across page reloads.
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Users can switch between dark mode and light mode.
- **Checkout Process**: Users can clear the cart after successful checkout.

## Project Overview:
- **HTML**: Structured the website with a product grid, cart system, and checkout interface.
- **CSS**: Styled the interface with a modern, responsive design. I also implemented hover effects and smooth transitions for an engaging user experience.
- **JavaScript**: Added interactivity by implementing:
  - Add-to-cart functionality.
  - Cart display and total price calculation.
  - Persistent cart data using **localStorage**.
  - Dark mode toggle feature for user preference.
  - Checkout process that clears the cart.

## Key Features:
- **Product Display**: Users can browse sports products, including items like Soccer Balls, Tennis Rackets, and more.
- **Add to Cart**: Each product has an "Add to Cart" button, updating the cart in real-time.
- **Persistent Cart**: Cart data is stored using **localStorage**, allowing it to persist even after page refreshes.
- **Total Price Calculation**: The total price of the cart is dynamically updated as products are added or removed.
- **Dark Mode**: A toggle to switch between light and dark modes for a personalized viewing experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring usability across mobile and desktop devices.
- **Checkout Process**: A simple checkout mechanism that clears the cart after the transaction.

## Task 1: Build Product Display and Cart System
In this task, I focused on developing the **product display** page and the **cart system**. Key functionalities include:
- Displaying products with their names, images, and prices.
- Adding products to the cart with a button.
- Updating the cart dynamically and calculating the total price.

## Task 2: Implement Dark Mode Toggle
The second part of this project involved adding a **dark mode toggle**. This feature allows users to switch between light and dark themes based on their preference. The userâ€™s dark mode choice is saved using **localStorage** for persistence.

## Skills & Technologies:
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the website, including the product grid, cart, and checkout sections.
- **CSS**: Styled the website with modern, responsive layouts, smooth transitions, and hover effects.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented the dynamic features such as:
